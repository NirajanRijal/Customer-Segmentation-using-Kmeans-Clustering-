What is clustering?
- Clustering is a fundamental technique in data analysis and machine learning that involves grouping similar data points based on their characteristics.

What is Elbow point method in K-means clustering?
- The Elbow Method is a visual approach used to determine the ideal ‘K’ (number of clusters) in K-means clustering. It operates by calculating the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS), which is the total of the squared distances between data points and their cluster center.

General Example: K means clustering
Suppose that the data mining task is to cluster points into three clusters, where the points are
A1(2, 10), A2(2, 5), A3(8, 4), B1(5, 8), B2(7, 5), B3(6, 4), C1(1, 2), C2(4, 9).
The distance function is Euclidean distance. 
Suppose initially we assign A1, B1, and C1 as the center of each cluster, respectively.
