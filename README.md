What is clustering?
- Clustering is a fundamental technique in data analysis and machine learning that involves grouping similar data points based on their characteristics.

What is Elbow point method in K-means clustering?
- The Elbow Method is a visual approach used to determine the ideal ‘K’ (number of clusters) in K-means clustering. It operates by calculating the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS), which is the total of the squared distances between data points and their cluster center.
